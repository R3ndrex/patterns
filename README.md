# Running a Python Application (.py File)

To run a Python application with a .py extension, follow these steps if you already have Python installed on your computer:

1. Open the command prompt or terminal on your computer. In Windows, this could be Command Prompt or PowerShell, while in Linux or macOS, you would use a terminal.

2. Navigate to the directory where your .py file is located. You can use the `cd` command (in Windows) or `cd` (in Linux and macOS) to navigate through the file system.

3. Once you're in the directory with your .py file, execute the following command to run the application:

In Windows:
python filename.py


In Linux and macOS:
python3 filename.py

Here, `filename.py` should be replaced with the actual name of your Python script.

If Python is not installed on your computer, you'll need to install it first. You can download Python from the official Python website (https://www.python.org/downloads/) and follow the installation instructions for your operating system. After installation, you'll be able to run .py files using the commands mentioned above.
